# IoT Dashboard Builder

This is a work-in-progress project to build a customizable IoT dashboard system.

### Project Goals:
- Create a frontend dashboard to monitor and control IoT devices.
- Use Google Sheets as the backend for storing data and control states.
- Connect ESP32 devices using HTTP and JSON via a lightweight Arduino library.
- Support block-based UI: data display blocks and control blocks.

### Components:
- Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS – hosted on GitHub Pages or Netlify)
- Google Apps Script backend linked to a Google Sheet
- ESP32 Arduino library for easy integration

Stay tuned — more updates coming soon.
